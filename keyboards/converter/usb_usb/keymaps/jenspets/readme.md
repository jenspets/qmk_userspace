# jenspets' qmk config
This config is for the Hasu controller connected to a HHKB Pro 2 keyboard. 

## Keymap description
This uses jenspets' base 34-key layout that is common between keyboards, with the exception of keyboards with less than 34 keys. The layout is Colemak-dh with several layers. 

As the HHKB Pro 2 has an ANSI layout, the keymap uses the "fat-z" mod, where left shift is remapped as "z", and the row 2 left hand keys are shifted one place to the left. 

The base keymap is defined in the file users/jenspets/jenspets_keymap.h
