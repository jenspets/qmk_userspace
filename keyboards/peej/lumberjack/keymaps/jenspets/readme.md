This keymap is based on a 34 key base layout that can be used across a wide variety of keyboards. It requires 4 easy accessible thumb keys, and the other keys are "convenience keys". The layout uses homerow mods and has AltGr on the top corner of the alpha-row to fascilitate international keycodes.
