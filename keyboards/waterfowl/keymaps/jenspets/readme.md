# Waterfowl keymap

The keymap is based on the 34-key base map defined in users/jenspets/. 

## Compile
The compile commands for the firmware is:

	qmk flash -kb waterfowl -km jenspets -bl uf2-split-left
	qmk flash -kb waterfowl -km jenspets -bl uf2-split-right

## TODOs
- Make a nice logo (the waterfowl is nice, but want to make it my own)
- Figure out what to use encoders for
  - Page up/ down and volume is two I use on the Kyria, but what with the other two?
