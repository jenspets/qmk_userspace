# Waterfowl keymap

The keymap is based on the 34-key base map defined in users/jenspets/. 

## TODOs
- Figure out how to set right controller as main. Now OLEDs are upside down if I connect USB to the right controller
- Add layer description to OLED
- Add WPM counter / animation
- Make a nice logo (the waterfowl is nice, but want to make it my own)
- Figure out what to use encoders for
  - Page up/ down and volume is two I use on the Kyria, but what with the other two?
